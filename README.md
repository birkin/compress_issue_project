### overview

This is a small project to demonstrate a problem I'm have with using a package, created in preparation for asking a question for help.

---

### usage

From the terminal...

- `mkdir ./stuff`

- `cd ./stuff`

- `git clone git@github.com:birkin/compress_issue_project.git`

- `cd ./compress_issue_project`

- `docker-compose up`

    At this point, the web-app will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`
